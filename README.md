## Key Data Preparation Steps (SQL-Based)

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**  
   - Dataset consists of 48,620 rows and 12 columns

2. **Data Cleaning in SQL Server**
   - **Null Checks:** Verified no nulls in critical fields  
   - **Duplicate Removal:** Ensured unique pizza entries per order  
   - **Categorical Standardization:**  
     - Converted size codes (S, M, L, XL) to full text (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large)  
     - Standardized casing in pizza_category  
   - **Outlier Detection:** Confirmed all unit_price values were within logical range

## Recommendations

### Sales Trend Optimization

- **Seasonal Promotions:** Reinforce marketing efforts during low-performing months (e.g., Septemberâ€“October) by:
  - Launching targeted ads for past buyers and lookalike audiences
  - Collaborating with food influencers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube
  - Running email marketing campaigns with festive themes and exclusive discounts
  - Leveraging seasonal messaging to create urgency and boost interest
- **Flash Deals During Peak Hours:** Capitalize on demand spikes at 13:00 (lunch) and 17:00â€“19:00 (dinner) with time-limited discounts or combo deals.
- **Friday-Focused Offers:** Launch new products or value bundles on Fridaysâ€”the top sales dayâ€”to maximize visibility and conversion.

### Menu & Product Strategy

- **Bundle High-Demand Sizes:** Promote Large and Medium pizzas in family combos or "Buy One Get One" campaigns.
- **Rationalize Oversized Options:** Review performance of Extra Large and Double Extra Large pizzas; reduce stock or repackage for parties.
- **Promote Veggie Options:** Support the growing Veggie segment through health-conscious or eco-themed campaigns like "Meatless Mondays."

### Customer Engagement

- **Launch Weekly Offers:** Introduce midweek promotions (e.g., "Two-Topping Tuesdays" or free drink with pizza) to boost slow weekdays.
- **Loyalty Programs:** Encourage repeat orders with pizza points, tier-based discounts, or birthday rewards.

### Operational Planning

- **Improve Inventory Forecasting:** Use daily/hourly sales patterns to plan dough and ingredient prep, minimizing overstock and waste.
- **Optimize Labor Scheduling:** Align staff shifts with peak demand hours to ensure fast service and reduce downtime.
