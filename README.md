This project analyzes a full year of pizza sales data (2015) to uncover performance trends across product categories, sizes, and customer behavior. Built in Power BI, the dashboard identifies key growth periods, optimal selling times, and product preferences to support strategic decisions in marketing, inventory, and operations for a pizza chain.

## Key Data Preparation Steps (SQL-Based)

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**  
   - Dataset consists of 48,620 rows and 12 columns

2. **Data Cleaning in SQL Server**
   - **Null Checks:** Verified no nulls in critical fields  
   - **Duplicate Removal:** Ensured unique pizza entries per order  
   - **Categorical Standardization:**  
     - Converted size codes (S, M, L, XL) to full text (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large)  
     - Standardized casing in pizza_category  
   - **Outlier Detection:** Confirmed all unit_price values were within logical range

  - Collaborating with food influencers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube
  - Running email marketing campaigns with festive themes and exclusive discounts
  - Leveraging seasonal messaging to create urgency and boost interest
- **Flash Deals During Peak Hours:** Capitalize on demand spikes at 13:00 (lunch) and 17:00â€“19:00 (dinner) with time-limited discounts or combo deals.

### Menu & Product Strategy

- **Bundle High-Demand Sizes:** Promote Large and Medium pizzas in family combos or "Buy One Get One" campaigns.

- **Loyalty Programs:** Encourage repeat orders with pizza points, tier-based discounts, or birthday rewards.

### Operational Planning

- **Improve Inventory Forecasting:** Use daily/hourly sales patterns to plan dough and ingredient prep, minimizing overstock and waste.
