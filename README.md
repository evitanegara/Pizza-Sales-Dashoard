# Business Understanding 
The Pizza Sales Dashboard project aims to analyze sales data to uncover performance trends, customer behavior, and operational insights. By leveraging data from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2015, the dashboard enables a data-driven understanding of revenue patterns, product performance, and time-based sales behavior. The end goal is to guide strategic decision-making that enhances profitability, customer targeting, and overall business efficiency.
Understanding digital sales footprints helps businesses:
- Anticipate customer needs and preferences
- Track high- and low-performing products
- Optimize promotions based on time, size, and category patterns
- Improve customer retention and satisfaction
